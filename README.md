# VulkanLearningAgain
This is just a personal project so I can finally get around to learning Vulkan in more detail.

This will initially take the form of a simple space simulator beginning with a starfighter in an asteroid field. To give myself a challenge I'd also like to implement some basic collision physics between the asteroids in the field. Preferably on a large scale so that the field can come alive. This will be implemented on the GPU as much as possible.
